# About this visualization
We arrived at our story by first exploring the different data sets available. We looked at the examples
given to us and that eventually led us to a data set on hate crimes. 

To view the project connect through: python3 -m http.server

We did some exploratory data analysis (https://observablehq.com/d/5825032a909453aa) to see wha tour data looked like and what story we could tell. We saw that crimes against Muslims greatly increased  in 2001, which wasn't very surprising due to 9/11; however, it also rose in 2015 which was more surprising. A similar rise in crimes against Hispanic people was also seen in 2015. This was an interesting story for us to tell as there was an election in 2016.

Our besoke visualization came from our story. We want to shows the reader sthe events leading up to the rise in crimes. We did this by creating an animated graph that paused at important dates. We also wanted to show some potential resons for this rise, such as Trumps rhetoric about minority groups.

We then wanted to dive in further an explore if certain areas in the US had higher crime rates for those minority groups, so rather than a bar chart with 50 bars wer chose a choropleth map.

We are most proud of our bespoke visualization and the progress we have made since the start of class. The transitions in the bespoke visualization took a lot of thinking and planning, so we are really proud of the result. We are also really proud of how far we have come since the first week of class. If someone had told me we would be coding a "website-like" visualization, I would not have know the first place to start. So, completing this project was a succes in itself.

Ideally, we would have like the bespoke visualization to run each time you scroll to that section; however, we realized that it would take alot of rearranging, after completing it. So, we chose to leave it as is for now. We also had hoped to include a legend for our choropleth and possibly have a popup for a hover.
